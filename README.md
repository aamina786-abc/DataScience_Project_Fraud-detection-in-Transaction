# DataScience_Project_Fraud-detection-in-Transaction 
##**📌 Project Overview**

This project analyzes credit card transaction data to detect fraudulent activities.
The goal is to identify unauthorized transactions hidden within a large volume of legitimate transactions using machine learning techniques.

🎯 Business Questions

How effectively can fraudulent transactions be detected from transaction data?
Does Random Forest perform better than Logistic Regression for fraud detection?
How does class imbalance affect fraud prediction accuracy?
